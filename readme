******** HOW TO PLAY THE GAME ********
1) Input your name and your chips stack, click SUBMIT
2) Click the HIT button to draw new cards, and try to get as close as possible to or even hit 21 in total card value, without going over...
3) When you're happy with your cards, click the STAY button to reveal the dealer's hand and find out if you've won or lost.

 ******** KNOWN ISSUES / QUESTIONS ********
 - removing the "number" paremeter in drawCards throws error / drawCards(1, playerContainer, playerCards)
 
******** TO DO ********
 - JS: Simplify the HIT and STAY conditional styles in JS (probably with query selector etc. similar to the h1 effect)
 - Implement winning/losing chips 
 - Code ace's value either 1 or 11 depending on when it is drawn
 - CSS color variables
 - Avatar picker for the player (based on Per's emoji fighter, with a dropdown menu)
 - Implement a modal window for rules

 - WAY DOWN THE LINE: multi-player (radio input?) + code
